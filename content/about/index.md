## Recommendations
> I have worked with him on both of external and internal products since his first day at Lalamove. Andrew’s single greatest strength is a combination of two: he always drives for a high level of quality in his work while also challenging the status quo; seeking better ways of doing things. I attribute both of these strengths to his willingness.
> 
> Having worked in product designs around 10 years, I am well equipped to say that Andrew has the potential to be a leader in this field.

> Andrew is a humble developer, fast learner and good teacher (willing to teach other). He can always keep me a good recommendation when I work with a web related project. I remember he help me a lot as I am not familiar with JavaScript framework.
