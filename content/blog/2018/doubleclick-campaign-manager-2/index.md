We will create a creative with associate advertiser profile created in the previous tutorial.

## 3. Upload creatives with associate advertiser profile

Those code generated in the previous section should be placed in your creative so that those dynamic contents can be shown. Or you can use Google Web Designer to design creatives with advertiser profile associated.

When you create a new blank file in Google Web Designer, choose **DoubleClick** as your environment.
