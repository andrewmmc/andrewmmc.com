The project proposed a new system called Education Catalog Platform. It is designed for students and education providers in the education market. 

Users can search, compare and register different courses online. Education providers can provide their information to public via the platform. It can benefit both sides as students can save money to have better education courses, and education providers can promote their services to potential students with a online payment gateway.
