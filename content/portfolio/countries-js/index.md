Built with [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup), available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/countries-js).

A simple JS library for returning data about countries. It supports npm with webpack or old-school way.

The original thought for creating this library is basically for my personal project. It is because I found that some libraries on npm are unmaintained or do not fit my need. However, I hope it helps someone who needs countries data by open-sourcing it.
