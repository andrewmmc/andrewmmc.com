Built with [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/cloud-functions-go-1-11-is-now-a-supported-language).

**Pick** is the best bot to help you making a quick decision from different choices in Slack.

Hard to make a quick decision? Don't want to waste your time to decide something you don't really care about?

- Where to go for team lunch?
- What should we organzie for next team-building activity?
- Who should be the one to lead this project?
- ..... more questions that you don't want to put too much effort on it

Simply ask `/pick` to help you picking one from the choices. Even you can use it for **lucky draw**, to see who are in lucky too!
