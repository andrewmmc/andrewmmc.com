#### Creating ads with dynamic targeting key filtering in DoubleClick Campaign Manager (Part 2)

> **Update: **DoubleClick is now rebranded as Google Marketing Platform. DoubleClick Campaign Manager and DoubleClick Studio are under one product called Display & Video 360 now. See [this post](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/9015629) and [this post](https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/) for more details.

In the [previous article](https://medium.com/andrewmmc-io/import-dynamic-feed-to-advertiser-profile-in-doubleclick-studio-dbef1fa51384), we talked about how to import dynamic feed to advertiser profile in DoubleClick Studio. In this article, we will create a creative with associate advertiser profile created in the previous tutorial.

### 3. Upload creatives with associate advertiser profile

Those code generated in the previous section should be placed in your creative so that those dynamic contents can be shown. Or you can use Google Web Designer to design creatives with advertiser profile associated.

When you create a new blank file in Google Web Designer, choose **DoubleClick** as your environment.

You can start your creation after created a new blank file. After that, to import the dynamic content from the advertiser profile, Click **Dynamic** tab next to **Events**, and click the **Add** icon at the bottom.

For the first time, you are required to log in to your Google account. After that, you can choose the advertiser and profile from your account. You will see dynamic contents source and you may need to link them with your page elements.

After that, just publish your creatives by clicking the **Publish** icon at top right corner. Switch back to DoubleClick Studio, and click the **Creatives** tab at the navigation bar.
