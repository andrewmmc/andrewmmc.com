#### Creating ads with dynamic targeting key filtering in DoubleClick Campaign Manager (Part 3)

> **Update: **DoubleClick is now rebranded as Google Marketing Platform. DoubleClick Campaign Manager and DoubleClick Studio are under one product called Display & Video 360 now. See [this post](https://support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/9015629) and [this post](https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/) for more details.

In the [previous article](https://medium.com/andrewmmc-io/create-dynamic-creatives-in-google-web-designer-with-doubleclick-studio-da47141026e), we talked about how to upload a creative with associate advertiser profile to DoubleClick Studio. In this article, we will manage our ads with dynamic targeting key in DoubleClick Campaign Manager.

### 4. Create a new campaign

You can manage your ads and campaigns in DoubleClick Campaign Manager. Click **Campaigns** section, and choose a campaign that you would like to continue. If you have no campaign created before, you can click **New** button to create a new campaign.

Click **New** button, and click **Ad Standard** to add a new ad. If you have no ad placement created before, a new ad placement will be automatically created for your new ad.

You can see a new window at the right bottom corner. You need to fill in a name for this ad for identification. Also, you can set different properties for this ad, like the advertising period and impression ratio (comparing to other ads in the same ad placement).

You need to assign at least one creative to this ad. Click **Edit creative assignments** and choose the dynamic creative you uploaded to DoubleClick Studio in the previous tutorial.

After that, you need to set up dynamic targeting keys for this ad or ad placement. Click **Assign targeting key** and add your targeting key you would like to relate to this ad.
